# MetalPerformanceShaders-SplitEasy

This repository contains some of the training code for simple neural network models for Split Easy [https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04232](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04232) written using the Metal Performance Shaders(MPS). 

The goal is to update this code since building models using MPS lack good documentation and this project could serve as a good starting point for any new work using this framework.
